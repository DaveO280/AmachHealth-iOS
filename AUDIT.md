# iOS App Audit — Remaining Work
_Last updated: 2026-02-24_

The items below are what's left after the in-code blockers were resolved in
commit `ios-app-audit-oy9DE`.  They are ordered by severity.

---

## 🔴 BLOCKERS — must fix before any build succeeds in Xcode

### 1. No Xcode project / app target
**Status:** `Package.swift` defines a library target, not an app target.
Xcode cannot install or run a library on a device or simulator.

**Path forward — two options (pick one):**

**Option A — keep SPM, add an Xcode app target wrapper**
```
File → New → Project → iOS App
  Product Name: AmachHealth
  Bundle ID: com.amach.health
  Language: Swift / SwiftUI lifecycle

After creation:
  1. Delete the generated ContentView.swift
  2. In Xcode → Project Settings → Package Dependencies, add the local
     AmachHealth package (the folder containing Package.swift)
  3. In Build Phases → Link Binary With Libraries, add AmachHealth
  4. Set the app's Info.plist to Resources/Info.plist
  5. Set the app's entitlements to Resources/AmachHealth.entitlements
```

**Option B — convert Package.swift to a native Xcode project**
```
In Package.swift, change the library target to an executable:
  .executableTarget(name: "AmachHealth", ...)

Then open with Xcode 15+ which will generate the project natively.
Note: executable targets can't use @main — you'd use the UIApplicationMain
entrypoint or a custom entry file.
```
Option A is the lower-risk path.

### 2. Missing asset catalog (`.xcassets`)
**Status:** `Info.plist` references `LaunchScreenBackground` (a named color)
and `LaunchIcon` (a named image).  Neither exists in the repo.

**What to add** (minimum viable set):
```
AmachHealth/Resources/Assets.xcassets/
  AppIcon.appiconset/          ← app icon (required for App Store)
  LaunchIcon.imageset/         ← logo shown on launch screen
  LaunchScreenBackground.colorset/  ← #0A1A15 (dark) launch color
```
`LaunchScreenBackground` color:
```json
{
  "colors": [
    { "idiom": "universal",
      "color": { "color-space": "srgb",
                 "components": {"red":"0.039","green":"0.102","blue":"0.082","alpha":"1"} } }
  ]
}
```

---

### 3. `PRIVY_APP_ID` placeholder
**Status:** `WalletService.swift` line 40 falls back to `"YOUR_PRIVY_APP_ID"`
if the environment variable isn't set.  Wallet auth silently uses the wrong ID.

**Fix:**
```
Xcode → Scheme → Edit Scheme → Run → Arguments → Environment Variables
  Name:  PRIVY_APP_ID
  Value: <your app ID from dashboard.privy.io>
```
For CI, add to the build environment/secrets.

## 🟡 WARNINGS — won't block a build, but need attention before TestFlight

### 4. Privy iOS SDK not integrated (`WalletService.swift`)
**Status:** Wallet connect/disconnect/sign are all dev mocks.
Real on-device wallet auth will not work until the Privy iOS SDK ships
and is wired in.

**What's stubbed (lines to replace when SDK is available):**
| Line | What it does now |
|------|-----------------|
| 54–76 | Privy login + embedded wallet — commented out |
| 80–95 | Dev mock connection (address, key, signature) |
| 104–105 | Privy logout — TODO comment |
| 117–121 | Privy message signing — throws `.notImplemented` |

**Package.swift** already has the Privy dependency commented out.
When the SDK is available:
1. Uncomment the `.package(url: ...)` line in `Package.swift`
2. Replace the DEV MOCK block (lines 78–95) with the commented Privy flow above it
3. Uncomment the `Privy.shared.logout()` call in `disconnect()`
4. Replace the `throw WalletError.notImplemented` in `signMessage(_:)` with the Privy signing call

### 5. `AppState` not yet bridged to live service state
**Status:** `AppState` is now injected into the environment (fixed in this
PR).  But nothing calls `appState.setWallet()`, `appState.setHealthKit()`,
or `appState.recordSync()` when those services update at runtime.  The
initial seed in `.task { }` only runs once on launch.

**Recommended approach:** Make `WalletService` and `HealthKitService` accept
an `AppState` reference and call the bridge methods on publish:
```swift
// WalletService — in connect() / disconnect():
appState.setWallet(address: self.address)

// HealthKitService — after requestAuthorization():
appState.setHealthKit(authorized: self.isAuthorized)

// HealthDataSyncService — at end of successful sync:
appState.recordSync(tier: result.tier, score: result.score)
```
This is low-risk but requires threading `appState` into three services.

### 6. Orientation lock — portrait-only recommended
**Status:** `Info.plist` currently allows portrait + both landscape orientations.
The app's layout (tab bar, FAB, chat input) is designed for portrait.
Landscape was likely left in by default.

**Fix:** Remove `UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeLeft` and
`UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRight` from `UISupportedInterfaceOrientations`
in `Info.plist` (keep the iPad `~ipad` key as-is if iPad support is intended).

### 7. `preferredColorScheme(.dark)` forced globally
**Status:** `AmachHealthApp.swift` forces dark mode app-wide.
Light mode (amber/cream gradient) is defined in the design system but never
shown in-app.

**Options:**
- Keep forced dark if dark-only is the intended v1 stance
- Remove the modifier and let the OS control it (design system already has
  both color scheme implementations)

---

## 🟢 DEFERRED / INTENTIONAL (no action needed now)

### 8. Test TODOs
- `APIClientTests.swift` lines 326–331: 6 integration tests marked TODO.
  Core SSE parsing tests exist and pass.
- `ChatServiceTests.swift` lines 247–250: 3 simulator-only streaming tests.
- `HealthKitMappingTests.swift` line 367: 1 device-only test.

All are intentionally deferred.  Run `swift test` from the package root to
verify existing tests pass.

### 9. `signMessage` throws `.notImplemented` in key derivation path
`deriveEncryptionKey()` calls `signMessage()` which throws.  This means
`deriveEncryptionKey()` also always throws.  In the current dev mock flow,
`deriveEncryptionKey()` is never called — the dev key is constructed
directly.  Once Privy signs in, both functions will work together.  No
action needed until then.

---

### 10. Key derivation message must match the web app exactly
**Status:** `WalletService.swift` builds the signing message as:

```
Sign this message to derive your encryption key.

This key is used to encrypt your health data before storage.

It will NOT be sent to our servers.
Timestamp: %d          ← millisecond epoch, formatted with String(format:)
```

The web app (`Amach-Website`) must use the **identical string** — same
wording, same whitespace, same newlines, same timestamp unit.  If there is
any difference the two apps will derive different encryption keys from the
same wallet signature, and iOS will be unable to decrypt data written by the
web app (and vice versa).

**How to verify:**
1. Open `Amach-Website` and search for `signMessage` or `deriveEncryptionKey`
   to find where the signing message is constructed.
2. Compare character-for-character with `keyDerivationMessage` in
   `WalletService.swift` lines 29–36.
3. Confirm the timestamp is passed as milliseconds (`Date.now()` in JS vs
   `Int(Date().timeIntervalSince1970 * 1000)` in Swift) and formatted the
   same way in both strings.

If they differ, one side needs to be updated — whichever was written first
should be treated as the canonical version.
